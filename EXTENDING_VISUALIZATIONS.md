# Extending Visualizations in the Singleton Pattern

In this version of the project, all visualizations are consolidated into a Singleton class within the `main.js` file. To extend or add new visualizations, follow the guidelines below:

1. **Navigate to `main.js`**: Locate the Visualizations class within the `main.js` file.
2. **Create a New Method**: Add your visualization logic as a new method within the Visualizations class.
3. **Follow the Existing Pattern**: Use the existing methods as a reference for how to structure your visualization code.

Example:
```javascript
class Visualizations {
    // ...
    yourNewVisualization() {
        // Your visualization code here
    }
    // ...
}
```
