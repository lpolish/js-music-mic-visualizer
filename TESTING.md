# 🧪 Testing Guide for Psychedelic Canvas Visualizations

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for writing and running tests for the psychedelic canvas visualizations project. Following these guidelines ensures consistency, reliability, and accuracy across the visualizations.

## 🛠️ Test Framework and Tools

We are using Jest and other relevant libraries for testing.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure Node.js v14 or higher is installed.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed using \`npm install\`.

## 🧪 Writing Tests

### Structure

Tests should be organized in corresponding folders within the \`tests\` directory. Each visualization should have its own test file.

### Naming Conventions

- Test files should be named according to the visualization they correspond to, e.g., \`visualization7.test.js\`.

### Test Case Structure

Each test file should contain multiple test cases to validate individual elements of a visualization, including mathematical calculations, canvas drawing functionality, etc.

```javascript
describe('Visualization7', () =&gt; {
  test('should calculate the correct angle', () =&gt; {
    // Test code here...
  });
  test('should draw the shape correctly', () =&gt; {
    // Test code here...
  });
  // Additional test cases...
});
```

## 🚀 Running Tests

Execute the following command to run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

You can also run specific tests using:

```bash
npm test -- visualization7.test.js
```

## ✅ Best Practices

- Write modular and maintainable test cases.
- Use mock functions for external dependencies.
- Ensure thorough coverage by including edge cases.
- Document any complex calculations or logic within the test cases.
